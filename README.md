# AI Agents
This repository contains projects for implementing AI agents. 

## Projects:

ðŸ¤– **Sistema Multiagente com Google Gemini: Criador de Post para Instagram**

(Multi-Agent System with Google Gemini: Instagram Post Creator)
 - This project is a practical application of Artificial Intelligence applied to digital marketing, developed during the AI â€‹â€‹Immersion promoted by Alura + Google. The system uses autonomous agents based on generative AI to create complete content for social networks (Instagram), focusing on current launches and trends. Small adaptations and modifications were made to the original code.

ðŸ¤– **AI Multi-Agent Writer**
- This project demonstrates the creation of a collaborative system consisting of three AI agentsâ€”a planner, a writer, and an editorâ€”that work together to automatically produce optimized, cohesive articles based on a central theme. The system is powered by the LLaMA 3 model via Ollama and orchestrated by the CrewAI library.

ðŸ¤– **Stride Agent: Agente para DetecÃ§Ã£o de Vulnerabilidades em Arquiteturas** *

(Stride Agent: Agent for Vulnerability Detection in Architectures)
- This project was implemented as part of a cybersecurity challenge applied to modern architectures, using: 1. **Python + FastAPI** for the backend API; 2. **Azure OpenAI** for generating threat models via prompt engineering; 3. **Cytoscape.js** for visualizing the threat graph. The goal is to demonstrate how the STRIDE methodology can be automatically applied to support risk analysis in software architectures. This project was implemented as a "project challenge" for the BairesDev - Machine Learning Training course, promoted by Dio in partnership with BairesDev.

ðŸ¤– **Gerador AutomÃ¡tico de Testes Pytest com Azure OpenAI** *

(Automatic Pytest Test Generator with Azure OpenAI)
- An intelligent agent that uses LangChain and Azure OpenAI to automatically generate comprehensive and well-structured pytest test files from Python modules. This project was implemented as a "project challenge" for the BairesDev - Machine Learning Training course, promoted by Dio in partnership with BairesDev.
